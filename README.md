fmriqa
======

qa scripts for fMRI data

- creates a summary report of quality for an fMRI dataset
- estimates FD/DVARS (Power et al., 2012)
- performs Greve et al./fBIRN spike detection

Dependencies:
- statsmodels
- numpy
- nibabel
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- reportlab

USAGE: fmriqa.py bold_mcf.nii.gz (or any suitably named file)

- this main program takes in a motion-corrected image and performs QA
-- report is saved to a subdirectory called QA
- it assumes that the following also exist in the same directory (if infile is called bold_mcf.nii.gz):
-- bold_mcf_brain_mask.nii.gz: BET mask
-- bold_mcf.par: motion parameters generated by mcflirt

Useful output for accounting for motion in first level feat models - 'confounds.txt'
- columns 1-6:   motion parameters from mcflirt (translation and rotation in x, y, and z directions)
- columns 7-12:  derivatives of motion parameters
- column 13:     framewise displacement (1=volume above threshold, 0=volume below threshold)
- column 14:     DVARS: square root of the variance in intensity between consecutive volumes
- column 15+:    additional nuisance regressor(s) dummy coded for volumes above FD threshold
